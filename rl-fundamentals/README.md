# Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals

A collection of hands-on exercises to learn Reinforcement Learning from scratch.

## Exercises

### 1. Ping Pong Q-Learning
Build a Q-Learning agent that learns to play Ping Pong through self-play. Covers:
- State space discretization
- Q-Learning implementation
- Self-play training
- Reward function design

### 2. Coming Soon...
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- Policy Gradient Methods
- Actor-Critic Architectures

## Structure
Each exercise folder contains:
- Complete environment implementation
- Exercise-specific README with detailed instructions
- Template files for implementing the RL components
- Testing and evaluation tools

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyGame
- NumPy
- Basic understanding of Python and ML concepts
